        <h1>Visualizing Traffic Accidents in NYC: Explainer</h2>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Our dataset consists of observations of vehicle collisions, from September 2013 to April 2018. With this 
                dataset, we wanted to show the user which types of accidents occured more often, and which areas of NYC 
                has the highest number of collisions.
            </p>
            <p>Link to original dataset: <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">
                https://data.cityofnewyork.us/</a></p>
        <h2>Basic stats</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset contains 1.26 million rows and 29 columns. The columns contains different types of 
                information, such as location of the collission, the number of vehicles involved, and the type of the 
                vehicles, number of injuries, fatalities and contributing factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our analysis of the dataset, we have focused on the types of vehicles, along with the number of 
                injuries and fatalities. We have created two datasets, one simply containing the number of accidents
                for each day in the dataset, and another with each observation of a collision in 2017, where we have 
                extracted the information of interest, i.e. if a pedestrian or cyclist were involved, if a taxi was 
                involved, and how many vehicles were involved in the collision.
            </p>
        <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>
                Our data visualizations are of the type annotated chart. They are reader driven, as the reader can 
                filter and explore the data, as the user wishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have used the following types of Visual Narrative:
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual Structuring: Progress Bar / Timebar</li>
                    <li>Highlighting: Zooming</li>
                    <li>Transistion Guidance: Animated Transitions</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We have used the following types of Narrative Structure:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ordering: Linear</li>
                    <li>Interactivity: Filtering / Selection / Search, Hover Highlighting / Details</li>
                    <li>Messaging: Captions / Headlines, Introductory Text</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We've chosen these visual narratives as we hope they help the user to understand the timeline of the 
                dataset. This we accomplish by using a timebar and making the visuals responsive and interactive by 
                animated transitions and the ability to zoom on the main timeline.    
                By using filtering and highlighting, we make all the relevant data available to the user for him to read, 
                and thereby understand the idea behind the visualizations.
            </p>
        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
            <p>
                Our visualizations are split in two parts. The first part show a timeline depicting the number of 
                collisions in each day of the period. The development in the number of daily accidents is then showed 
                in another chart with a lineplot. The viewer can then choose a period on the timeline, and then the 
                lineplot will update, to show the development in the chosen period.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second part, we wish to show which types of accidents occured most often in 2017. Here the user 
                can choose whether to see the number of accidents given time of day, type of accident (amount of cars 
                involved) or accidents by borough in New York City, by filtering the data with the use of radiobuttons. 
                When viewing the accidents for time of day, the user has the possibility to filter this data, only to 
                include accidents with taxis involved or accidents with pedestrians or cyclists involved. This can 
                provide an image of when most accidents involving these parties, occurs in the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea behind the first part, is to provide an overview for the user enabling him to see whether or 
                not there is some sort of tendency in the data etc. number of accidents increasing year by year or if 
                there's more accident during the winter. The second part is made, to provide the user detailed insights 
                in the year 2017. Filtering the data with regards to time of day, type of accident and borough where 
                the accidents happened.
            </p>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                Our initial thought was to show the full dataset in a map of New York City, but since there are more than 
                1.2 million observations, this was not feasible. Instead we looked into showing the collisions from 
                2017 on the map, but this was more than 200,000 rows, which wouldn't be very user friendly either. 
                So we decided to show the information in the stacked bar chart. If the visualizations should be improved, 
                it would be nice to show some geographical distribution, making some grouping of the number of collisions.
            </p>
