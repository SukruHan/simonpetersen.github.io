        <h1>Visualizing Traffic Accidents in NYC: Explainer</h2>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Our dataset consists of observations of vehicle collisions, from September 2013 to April 2018. With this 
                dataset, we wanted to show the user which types of accidents occured more often, and which areas of NYC 
                has the highest number of collisions.
            </p>

        <h2>Basic stats</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset contains 1.26 million rows and 29 columns. The columns contains different types of 
                information, such as location of the collission, the number of vehicles involved, and the type of the 
                vehicles, number of injuries, fatalities and contributing factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our analysis of the dataset, we have focused on the types of vehicles, along with the number of 
                injuries and fatalities. We have created two datasets, one simply containing the number of accidents
                for each day in the dataset, and another with each observation of a collision in 2017, where we have 
                extracted the information of interest, i.e. if a pedestrian or cyclist were involved, if a taxi was 
                involved, and how many vehicles were involved in the collision.
            </p>
        <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>
                Our data visualizations are of the type annotated chart. They are reader driven, as the reader can 
                filter and explore the data, as the user wishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have used the following types of Visual Narrative:
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual Structuring: Progress Bar / Timebar</li>
                    <li>Highlighting: Zooming</li>
                    <li>Transistion Guidance: Animated Transitions</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We have used the following types of Narrative Structure:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ordering: Linear</li>
                    <li>Interactivity: Filtering / Selection / Search, Hover Highlighting / Details</li>
                    <li>Messaging: Captions / Headlines, Introductory Text</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
            <p>
                Our visualizations are split in two parts. The first part show a timeline depicting the number of 
                collisions in each day of the period. The development in the number of daily accidents is then showed 
                in another chart with a lineplot. The viewer can then choose a period on the timeline, and then the 
                lineplot will update, to show the development in the chosen period.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second part, we wish to show which types of accidents occured most often in 2017. The user can 
                choose whether to see the number of accidents per time of day, or by borough in New York City. The user 
                can also filter to only show the number of accidents where taxis were involved, or where pedestrians or 
                cyclists were involved.
